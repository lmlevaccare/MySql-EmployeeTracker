# MySql-EmployeeTracker
This app creates a solution for managing a company's employees and uses a **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems interface which makes its easy for the end-user to view and interact with information stored in a database. I will use the following platforms to Design a database schema which interacts with a command-line application. 



* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
